**### Automating Amazon-SignInPage<br/>**
ğŸ‘‰As a part of improving my skills in test automation using Selenium java I automated the process of amazon sign page. <br/>
ğŸ‘‰Tools needed for this project:** **Java, selenium WebDriver libraries, Maven build, TestNG framework****
ğŸ‘‰This works only for few times because they added a captcha mechanism to prevent the automation of website using automation ways. <br/>
ğŸ‘‰To do automation for more number of times we have to automate captcha. <br/>
ğŸ‘‰If the captcha is automated it indicates a bug in the testing software. <br/>
ğŸ‘‰As a tester we can't do automation of captcha, it can be done only to find bug<br/>
ğŸ‘‰Amazon signin page is automated and the captcha is not automated <br/>
ğŸ‘‰Registration or user login page is automated
